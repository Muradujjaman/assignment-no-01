            <p>
                In today’s busy world being and staying focused is harder than ever. With text, notifications, social
                media, and email it can be hard to stay focused on anything. Whether it’s a task at work, focusing on
                your daily schedule, or your long-term goals. Those who are the most focused usually have the most
                energy and are greatly rewarded for their efforts. As Tony Robbins said, “Where focus goes, energy
                flows.”

            <h3>Time Management <br> of Mine</h3>
            <p class="plans-pra">
                Time is a priceless asset. The time, once lost, cannot be reclaimed and reused ever. That is why we must
                harness the time available in such a way, to get the most benefit out of it. Success only approaches
                when a person utilizes his/her time suitably and efficiently.

                The skill of time management will make more goals oriented and help one realize dreams. The first thing
                that one can do is to make a list of daily activities. It should include even the activities one doesn’t
                consider necessary. Next, decide on the priority levels of every activity based on its urgency.
